### About
Hi, my name is Philipp and I am a PhD student at Ulm University in Germany. Previously I have completed a Bacherlor's degree with a major in mathematics at Ulm University and a Master's in stats at the University of Waterloo. Broadly speaking I am interested in applying mathematics and computer science to problems in statistics and ML. This interest has previously led me on a journey through learning theory, nonparamatric statistics and even the fascinating intersection of statistical physics, information theory, computational complexity and high-dimensional inference. Currently I am working in the more applied field of explainable AI (XAI). My main research objective is to investigate and improve existing methods by building bridges to more mature areas in ML and stats.


### Projects
To me it is better to try many small projects than few big ones. I have found that prioritizing the publishing of a project creates clarity and directs the focus to the essential. This is why I believe that it is crucial to [ship it!](https://changelog.com/shipit). Here you will find my shipped ideas.


### Notes (Not a Blog!)
The more I write down the less I have to remember. To keep my notes in one place and force myself to be rigorous with notation and style I have decided to make my notes public. 


### Get in Touch
If you spot a mistake in my notes, have a question about a project or just want to get in touch, I would be delighted to hear from you. You can reach me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/schroppel_p).
